            <h2>Our Journey</h2>
            <p>
              Founded by a small team of passionate developers, Moonlighter Games is dedicated to creating 
              memorable gaming experiences that resonate with players worldwide. Our first title, 
              Lawn Care Simulator, represents our commitment to finding joy in the everyday and 
              transforming simple activities into engaging gameplay.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe in sustainable game development, putting our team first, and creating games 
              that we ourselves would love to play. No crunch, no compromise on quality â€“ just 
              pure passion for great games.
